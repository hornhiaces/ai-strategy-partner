<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What does an AI consultant do for enterprises?</h3>
<p>An enterprise AI consultant helps organizations identify high-value AI opportunities, develop implementation strategies, select the right technologies and vendors, navigate regulatory requirements, and move AI projects from pilot to production. Salinas AI Consulting focuses specifically on regulated industries where governance and compliance are critical.</p>

<h3>How much does enterprise AI consulting cost?</h3>
<p>Enterprise AI consulting engagements typically range from focused assessments (1-2 weeks) to full implementation advisory (3-6 months). Pricing depends on scope, complexity, and industry requirements. Salinas AI Consulting offers a free initial consultation to assess needs and provide a tailored proposal.</p>

<h3>What industries does Salinas AI Consulting specialize in?</h3>
<p>Salinas AI Consulting specializes in regulated industries: healthcare, financial services, and government. These sectors require deep understanding of compliance frameworks (HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP), data governance, and risk management when deploying AI systems.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between AI strategy and AI implementation consulting?</h3>
<p>AI strategy consulting focuses on identifying where AI creates business value and creating a roadmap. AI implementation consulting takes that strategy and turns it into working systems — selecting technologies, building governance frameworks, managing change, and ensuring production readiness. Salinas AI Consulting provides both, end-to-end.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to implement AI in an enterprise?</h3>
<p>A typical enterprise AI implementation takes 3-12 months from strategy to production, depending on complexity, data readiness, and organizational maturity. Quick wins like process automation can be achieved in 4-8 weeks. Larger initiatives like predictive analytics platforms require 6-12 months for full deployment with proper governance.</p>

<h3>Do I need an AI consultant if I already have a data science team?</h3>
<p>Yes, in many cases. Internal data science teams excel at model building, but enterprise AI success requires strategy alignment, governance frameworks, change management, vendor evaluation, and executive communication. A consultant provides the strategic layer that connects technical capability to business outcomes — especially critical in regulated industries.</p>

<h3>What is AI governance and why does it matter?</h3>
<p>AI governance is the framework of policies, processes, and controls that ensure AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with regulations. It covers model validation, bias monitoring, audit trails, data privacy, and risk management. In regulated industries, robust AI governance is not optional — it is a legal and operational requirement.</p>

<h3>How do you ensure AI compliance in regulated industries?</h3>
<p>Salinas AI Consulting builds compliance into every phase of AI implementation: identifying applicable regulations during strategy, designing governance frameworks during architecture, implementing audit trails and monitoring during build, and establishing ongoing compliance processes during handoff. We work with legal and compliance teams to ensure all regulatory requirements (HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP, etc.) are fully addressed.</p>
