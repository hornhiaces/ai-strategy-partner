<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What does an AI consultant do for enterprises?</h3>
<p>An enterprise AI consultant helps organizations identify high-value AI opportunities, develop implementation strategies, select the right technologies and vendors, navigate regulatory requirements, and move AI projects from pilot to production. Salinas AI Consulting focuses specifically on regulated industries where governance and compliance are critical to success.</p>

<h3>How much does enterprise AI consulting cost?</h3>
<p>Enterprise AI consulting engagements typically range from focused assessments (1-2 weeks) to full implementation advisory (3-6 months). Pricing depends on scope, complexity, and industry requirements. Salinas AI Consulting offers a free initial consultation to assess needs and provide a tailored proposal with transparent pricing.</p>

<h3>What industries does Salinas AI Consulting specialize in?</h3>
<p>Salinas AI Consulting specializes in three regulated industry sectors: healthcare (HIPAA, FDA compliance), financial services (SOX, FINRA, PCI-DSS compliance), and government (FedRAMP, FISMA compliance). These sectors require deep understanding of compliance frameworks, data governance, and risk management when deploying AI systems.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between AI strategy and AI implementation consulting?</h3>
<p>AI strategy consulting focuses on identifying where AI creates business value, assessing organizational readiness, and creating a prioritized roadmap. AI implementation consulting takes that strategy and turns it into working systems — selecting technologies, building governance frameworks, managing organizational change, and ensuring production readiness. Salinas AI Consulting provides both strategy and implementation, end-to-end.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to implement AI in an enterprise?</h3>
<p>A typical enterprise AI implementation takes 3-12 months from strategy to production, depending on complexity, data readiness, and organizational maturity. Quick wins like process automation can be achieved in 4-8 weeks. Larger initiatives like enterprise-wide predictive analytics platforms require 6-12 months for full deployment with proper governance and compliance.</p>

<h3>Do I need an AI consultant if I already have a data science team?</h3>
<p>Yes, in many cases. Internal data science teams excel at model building, but enterprise AI success requires strategy alignment, governance frameworks, change management, vendor evaluation, and executive communication. An AI consultant provides the strategic layer that connects technical capability to business outcomes — especially critical in regulated industries where compliance requirements add complexity.</p>

<h3>What is AI governance and why does it matter?</h3>
<p>AI governance is the framework of policies, processes, and controls that ensure AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with regulations. It covers model validation, bias monitoring, audit trails, data privacy, and risk management. In regulated industries like healthcare and financial services, robust AI governance is not optional — it is a legal and operational requirement.</p>

<h3>How do you ensure AI compliance in regulated industries?</h3>
<p>Salinas AI Consulting builds compliance into every phase of AI implementation: identifying applicable regulations during strategy, designing governance frameworks during architecture, implementing audit trails and monitoring during build, and establishing ongoing compliance processes during handoff. We work with legal and compliance teams to ensure all regulatory requirements (HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP, etc.) are fully addressed before deployment.</p>

<h3>What makes Salinas AI Consulting different from large consulting firms?</h3>
<p>Three key differences: (1) 100% independence — no vendor partnerships, reseller agreements, or technology commissions influencing recommendations. (2) Regulated industry specialization — not a generalist firm, but deep expertise in healthcare, financial services, and government AI deployments. (3) Practical focus — emphasis on working production systems and measurable outcomes, not theoretical frameworks or extended discovery phases.</p>

<h3>Can you help with generative AI and large language model (LLM) implementation?</h3>
<p>Yes. Salinas AI Consulting provides advisory on generative AI strategy, LLM selection, prompt engineering architecture, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system design, responsible AI frameworks for generative applications, and production deployment of LLM-powered systems. This includes compliance considerations specific to generative AI in regulated industries.</p>
